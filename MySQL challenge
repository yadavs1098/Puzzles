In this MySQL challenge, your query should return the information for the employee with the third highest salary. Write a query that will find this employee and return that row, but then replace the DivisionID column with the corresponding DivisionName from the table cb_companydivisions. You should also replace the ManagerID column with the ManagerName if the ID exists in the table and is not NULL.

Your output should look like the following table.

SELECT maintable_6AW2B.ID,maintable_6AW2B.Name,cb_companydivisions.DivisionName,maintable_Manager.Name as ManagerName,maintable_6AW2B.Salary FROM maintable_6AW2B 
LEFT JOIN cb_companydivisions ON maintable_6AW2B.DivisionID=cb_companydivisions.ID
RIGHT JOIN maintable_6AW2B as maintable_Manager  ON maintable_6AW2B.ManagerID=maintable_Manager.ID 
Where maintable_6AW2B.ID=(SELECT maintable_6AW2B.ID FROM maintable_6AW2B ORDER BY maintable_6AW2B.Salary Desc  limit 2,1);
